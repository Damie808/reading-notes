Picking text editors is usually up to user preference. Use the editor that you are the most comfortable with first and foremost. 

Text editors allow you to edit website text the way you see fit. 

Features a text editor should include are : 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

[command line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different but here are a few places to start looking.

If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .

Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.

If you would like to know which shell you are using you may use a command called echo to display a system variable stating your current shell. echo is a command which is used to display messages.

EVERYTHING IS A FILE

Linux is extensionless. file types do not have to correlate with said file. EX= .img does not have to be a image file in linus

Linux is case sensitive

BE CAREFUL using spaces in file names.
