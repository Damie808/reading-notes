My Reading Notes

Hi my name is *Damie*! I am prior military and found an interest in coding. I hope that this course can eventually lead to me to a fruitful career in the tech industry. I enjoy spending my time gaming and watching anime.

**_Growth mindset is the ability to learn and advance through tough obstacles. Overcoming the fear of failure to grow and advance._**

3 **Reminders** to keep myself in the growth mindset:

 - Nothing worth while comes easy
 - The harder the task the sweeter the reward
 - Believe in yourself. It will get easier.
