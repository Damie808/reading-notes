[Html creating hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.


An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
  
[Css normal layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)
  
As detailed in the last lesson introducing layout, elements on a webpage lay out in normal flow if you haven't applied any CSS to change the way they behave. And, as we began to discover, you can change how elements behave either by adjusting their position in normal flow or by removing them from it altogether. Starting with a solid, well-structured document that's readable in normal flow is the best way to begin any webpage. It ensures that your content is readable even if the user's using a very limited browser or a device such as a screen reader that reads out the content of the page. In addition, since normal flow is designed to make a readable document, by starting in this way you're working with the document rather than struggling against it as you make changes to the layout.

Before digging deeper into different layout methods, it's worth revisiting some of the things you have studied in previous modules with regard to normal document flow.
  
  How are elements laid out by default?
The process begins as the boxes of individual elements are laid out in such a way that any padding, border, or margin they happen to have is added to their content. This is what we call the box model.

By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements. If you want to control the size of an inline element in this manner, you need to set it to behave like a block level element (e.g., with display: block; or display: inline-block;, which mixes characteristics from both).

That explains how elements are structured individually, but how about the way they're structured when they interact with one another? The normal layout flow (mentioned in the layout introduction article) is the system by which elements are placed inside the browser's viewport. By default, block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction, which is based on the parent's writing mode (initial: horizontal-tb). Each element will appear on a new line below the last one, with each one separated by whatever margin that's been specified. In English, for example, (or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode) block-level elements are laid out vertically.

Inline elements behave differently. They don't appear on new lines; instead, they all sit on the same line along with any adjacent (or wrapped) text content as long as there is space for them to do so inside the width of the parent block level element. If there isn't space, then the overflowing content will move down to a new line.

If two vertically adjacent elements both have a margin set on them and their margins touch, the larger of the two margins remains and the smaller one disappears. This is known as margin collapsing. Collapsing margins is only relevant in the vertical direction.
  
  [css layout positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)
  
  Positioning allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and make them behave differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another or by always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article explains the different position values and how to use them.
  
  Introducing positioning
Positioning allows us to produce interesting results by overriding normal document flow. What if you want to slightly alter the position of some boxes from their default flow position to give a slightly quirky, distressed feel? Positioning is your tool. Or what if you want to create a UI element that floats over the top of other parts of the page and/or always sits in the same place inside the browser window no matter how much the page is scrolled? Positioning makes such layout work possible.

There are a number of different types of positioning that you can put into effect on HTML elements. To make a specific type of positioning active on an element, we use the position property.

Static positioning
Static positioning is the default that every element gets. It just means "put the element into its normal position in the document flow — nothing special to see here."

To see this (and get your example set up for future sections) first add a class of positioned to the second <p> in the HTML:
  
  [JS functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)
  
  Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.

Where do I find functions?
In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through the course so far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.

Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — () — and you're not using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or if...else statement, you are making use of a function.

Built-in browser functions
We've used functions built in to the browser a lot in this course.
